In today's research landscape, being open and reproducible isn't just good practice —it's essential for trust and integrity. But how do we, as researchers, navigate these challenges? [Mind the GAP](https://www.ugent.be/en/news-events/podcast-mind-the-gap-research-integrity.htm) —a new podcast launched by VLIR— explores these fundamental questions, bringing together researchers from across the Flemish universities to discuss the values and practices that uphold the integrity of academic research. The series addresses essential topics such as authorship, retractions, research data management, the use of generative AI, and the unpredictable nature of research. Here's the overview of the series' episodes where, among others, Ghent University researchers and colleagues share their personal experiences:
