**Podcast Mind the GAP dives deeper into research integrity**

In line with our mission to foster transparent and responsible science, we are excited to share the launch of the **Mind the GAP** podcast by VLIR. This new series is designed for academic researchers, offering insights into maintaining integrity throughout the research process.

Mind the GAP provides a half-hour dive into real-life practices and challenges related to research integrity, featuring researchers from all five Flemish universities. The series addresses essential topics such as authorship, retractions, research data management, the use of generative AI, and the unpredictable nature of research.

Here's the overview of the series' episodes where, among others, Ghent University researchers and colleagues share their personal experiences:

1. **Research Integrity as a Challenging Concept**, with Aurélie Crabbé (Ghent University) and Kris Dierickx (KU Leuven)
2. **Research Data Management**, with Nicky Daniels (Hasselt University) and Laura Standaert (Ghent University)
3. **Corrections and Retractions**, with Gert Storms (KU Leuven, VCWI), Ivan Oransky (Retraction Watch), and Line Edslev Andersen (VUB)
4. **Generative A.I.**, with Walter Daelemans (University of Antwerp), Geert-Jan Bex (Hasselt University), and Vincent Ginis (VUB)
5. **Authorship**, with Ben Nemery (KU Leuven) and Kevin De Moortel (VUB)
6. **More than a Scientist**, with Charlotte De Backer (University of Antwerp) and Ernst Koster (Ghent University)

The podcast complements the online training tool Mind the GAP. A public version is available for those not affiliated with one of the Flemish institutions.
