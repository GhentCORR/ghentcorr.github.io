To boost the adoption of open science and FAIR data practices across Europe, OSCARS is launching two [Open Calls in 2024](https://oscars-project.eu/open-calls), with a total funding pool of €16 million. These calls aim to support innovative Open Science projects or services that drive FAIR-data-intensive research across the European Research Area (ERA). Researchers and research groups from various fields are encouraged to apply, with projects receiving between **€100 000 and €250 000**. The second call opens in **November 2024**.

Check some examples of [Open Science projects](https://oscars-project.eu/open-science-projects) that have received funding before.
