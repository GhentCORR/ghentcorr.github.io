What is preregistration, why does it matter, and how does it actually work in practice? Join us for an informal session where colleagues share their experiences with preregistration—the good, the tricky, and everything in between. Expect a relaxed setting with coffee, tea, cookies and open conversation. 

* Time: November 4th 2025, 15:00-16:30
* Location: Campus Dunant, Dunantlaan 2, Room 1.1

### Target audience
**No previous experience or knowledge about preregistration is needed**— just curiosity about reproducibility, open science, or good research practices. If you’re a researcher considering preregistration, or are already in the process, this is a great opportunity to learn from peers and ask your burning questions. Experienced already? Share your learnings with other researchers.

This event is part of a new series organized by GhentCORR (Ghent University Community on Open and Reproducible Research). Learn more and [connect with the community](https://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/org/ugent.be/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIyMDMyOTYzNDIwMTYifQ).

### Agenda
* Welcome and introduction, by Dries Debeer, Doctoral assistant in the field of experimental psychology.
* **Submitting a preprint to Peer Community in Health and Movement Sciences**. Annick De Paepe, Professor (ULB) and postdoctoral researcher (UGent) working in the field of health psychology, recently submitted a preprint to Peer Community in Health and Movement Sciences. In this talk, she will introduce Peer Community, explain how it works and share her personal experience with the submission process.
* **Publishing a preregistered report in the Royal Society Open Science**. Sophia Knoch and Reinoud Allaert are two doctoral students in the field of behavioral ecology who recently published a preregistered report in Royal Society Open Science: “Neophobia across social contexts in juvenile herring gulls.” They will walk us through the steps involved in this publication process, reflect on their experience with it (both challenges and highlights) and share some tips and recommendations.
* **Preparing a preregistered report for Peer Community In Registered Reports**. Louise Poppe, postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology and the Department of Public Health & Primary Care, will focus on the preregistered report she is currently preparing for Peer Community In Registered Reports. The report describes an observational study examining the impact of school-based greenspace on adolescent health. Louise will share her experiences with preregistering an observational study using open data, offering insights into the process and its practical implications.
