**Field**: Good research practices  
At the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, I support researchers in their efforts to adopt and implement good research practices. My interest lies in research data management as a catalyst for advancing open science. Additionally, I am deeply engaged in exploring the intersections between open science, ethics, and privacy.
