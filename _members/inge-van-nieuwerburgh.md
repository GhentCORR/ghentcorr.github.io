**Field**: Open scholarly communication  
I'm a member of the Open Science team and I help coordinating the community. My main interest is in supporting researchers to achieve open access to their research results, not only through advice, training and communication, but also by participating in European initiatives such as ‚Å†[OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/).
