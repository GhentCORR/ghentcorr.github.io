After nearly a year of building on the momentum from our <a href="https://ghentcorr.github.io/blog/2024/community_blueprint_workshop/">2024 blueprint workshop</a>, the community has taken shape— and we are thrilled to see it come to life together with all of you.</p> <p>The launch event brought together a diverse group of researchers, research support staff, and open science enthusiasts to share insights, reflect on challenges, and kick-start a collective journey toward more transparent and impactful research.</p> <h2 id="why-ghentcorr">Why GhentCORR?</h2> <p>In his welcome address, <strong>Research Director Ignace Lemahieu</strong> captured the spirit of the community perfectly: while ORR is embedded in Ghent University’s Framework for Good Research Practice, it is not always easy to implement. That’s the objective if GhentCORR — to support each other in taking meaningful steps forward. “This is your community,” he said. “Whether you lead a session, share a tool, or mentor a peer, your involvement will shape what GhentCORR becomes.”</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610131057_01.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610131057_01.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="keynote-highlights-from-data-sharing-to-data-solidarity">Keynote Highlights: From Data Sharing to Data Solidarity</h2> <p>Our keynote speaker, <strong><a href="https://www.sciensano.be/en/people/sofie-de-broe">Sofie De Broe (Sciensano)</a></strong>, took us through her professional journey in data governance, open health data, and the European health data space. Her talk made a <strong>strong case for ORR as a driver of real-world impact</strong>, especially in the health sciences. From wastewater monitoring to real-time dashboards, she showed how open data and FAIR practices are not just buzzwords—they make science more actionable and relevant.</p> <p>Sofie also emphasized the importance of <strong>data solidarity</strong>—the idea that contributing data can benefit society as a whole— and the need to build trust and reward structures that support openness. She reminded us that the path to sharing is not always simple, especially when navigating legal and ethical landscapes, but it is a path worth taking.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610131403_01.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610131403_01.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="a-snapshot-of-current-orr-practices-at-ghent-university">A snapshot of current ORR practices at Ghent University</h2> <p><a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/pieter-van-dessel-0/en">Pieter Van Dessel</a> gave a brief overview of an ORR landscape survey distributed across the Ghent University community by GhentCORR’s core team in early 2025 . While awareness of practices is relatively high, actual uptake is still limited—especially for preregistration, which is the least known and used. That said, many participants expressed strong intrinsic motivation and a desire for more support. A separate blog post will dive deeper into the results, but clearly, there is plenty of room for growth—and GhentCORR can help fill the gap.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610140555_01.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610140555_01.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="panel-takeaways-motivation-barriers-and-the-power-of-community">Panel takeaways: motivation, barriers, and the power of community</h2> <p>The panel discussion, moderated by Bregt Saenen (Science Europe and Ghent University alumnus), was a highlight of the afternoon, bringing in perspectives from across disciplines and roles—researchers, funders, journal editors, and policy advisors. While the challenges were familiar (time, funding, recognition), what stood out was the panel’s shared belief in the <strong>intrinsic value of ORR</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/sven-rogge-0/en">Sven Rogge (UGent)</a> talked about sharing research results that are reusable and the environmental impact of repeating simulations because of lack of transparency and reproducibility. He also pointed out the mismatch between commercial academic publishing practices and the inherent value research has for society.</li> <li><a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/nele-vandersickel-0/en">Nele Vandersickel (UGent)</a> described her group’s internal “mini-ecosystem” for sharing tools, code, and authorship leading to higher efficiency and reproducibility—an inspiring model of grassroots collaboration, placing it in juxtaposition with the evaluation and recognition of individual researchers.</li> <li><a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/antoinette-verhage-0/en">Antoinette Verhage (UGent)</a> shared how founding a diamond open access journal also helped build a strong, supportive academic community and an opportunity for researchers to develop new skills.</li> <li>Jan Mertens (FWO) gave insight into how funders are working to embed ORR into research assessment and evaluation frameworks. Narrative CVs, broader output categories, and new scoring rubrics are all part of the shift.</li> </ul> <p>Panellists also stressed the role of <strong>communities like GhentCORR</strong> in helping researchers make sense of evolving expectations, connect across fields, and support each other through trial and error. As Bregt Saenen put it: the knowledge is in the community—but it needs a structure to be shared.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610143817_01.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/IMG20250610143817_01.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="a-message-to-keep-us-going">A message to keep us going</h2> <p>We wrapped up the day with an encouraging video message from <strong>Judith Biernaux (ULiège &amp; RBINS)</strong>, who coordinates several open research initiatives in Belgium. Speaking from her experience with community building, Judith reminded us that peer-to-peer exchange is a powerful engine for sustainable cultural change. She encouraged us to focus on sustainability over scale, lean on each other, and keep the energy alive—even when things get quiet. Her message was a motivating close to the event, and a great reminder that community-led change takes time, care, and collective effort.</p> <h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2> <p>We’re not stopping here. The first in a series of informal, hands-on events—<a href="https://ghentcorr.github.io/blog/2025/2025-10-07-ghentcorr-launch-blog"><strong>Preregistration &amp; Coffee</strong></a>—is coming this October. These sessions will be all about sharing experiences, asking questions, and learning together in a relaxed setting about how ORR works in practice.</p> <p>Launching GhentCORR was a big milestone, but it is just the beginning. Whether you are looking to improve your data workflows, start a preregistration, publish open code, or simply connect with like-minded colleagues— <strong>this community is here for you</strong>.</p> <p>Let’s keep building it—together.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paula Oset</name></author><category term="events"/><category term="GhentCORR"/><category term="launch"/><category term="open science"/><category term="reproducibility"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Highlights from the GhentCORR launch event and the community's mission]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Researchers and staff gather to build a grassroots community on open and reproducible science</title><link href="https://ghentcorr.github.io/blog/2024/community_blueprint_workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Researchers and staff gather to build a grassroots community on open and reproducible science"/><published>2024-06-20T16:11:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-20T16:11:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ghentcorr.github.io/blog/2024/community_blueprint_workshop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ghentcorr.github.io/blog/2024/community_blueprint_workshop/"><![CDATA[<p>Over 20 researchers and research support staff gathered for a half-day workshop to build a blueprint for Ghent University’s first community on open and reproducible science on June 19th 2024. Supported by UGent’s Open Science team, researchers from different faculties as well as research support staff involved in research integrity, research ethics, research assessment and other areas of research policy brainstormed and voted on the identity of the future community and identified the next steps in building the community.</p> <p>We kicked off by getting to know each other and learning what makes us enthusiastic about open and reproducible science through a yarn toss game.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="values-what-is-important-to-us">Values: what is important to us?</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-6"> In a brainstorm on values for the community, we identified the wish for a horizontal community that is built by researchers, for researchers - a community in which both early and advanced career researchers feel welcomed, contribute and build on each other’s shoulders. Moreover, we want the community to have sharing, openness and FAIRness of research results at heart. </div> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/Values_results_visual02.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/Values_results_visual02.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="goals-what-do-we-want-to-achieve">Goals: what do we want to achieve?</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/Goals_VotingResults_02_b.jpeg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/Goals_VotingResults_02_b.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> We moved on to pinpoint the main goals of the future community. The top-goal is a change of research culture in which open and reproducible science is embedded into the daily practices of researchers. We want the community to help break down barriers and offer incentives for researchers that commit to making this transition to open and reproducible science happen. </div> </div> <h2 id="activities-what-can-we-do-to-achieve-it">Activities: what can we do to achieve it?</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-md-6"> Next, we came up with community activities that will lead to achieving these goals. Again, activities organized by researchers for researchers tailored to their needs and in their field of interest were identified as key. To allow for knowledge and practice exchange, both “local” info sessions, workshops and hackathons, as well as sharing of guidelines on best practices, examples and templates were pinned down as crucial activities. An open science award but also advocating for the necessary infrastructure to practice open and reproducible science are deemed important. </div> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/Activities_VotingResults_01.jpeg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/Activities_VotingResults_01.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="mission-statement">Mission statement</h2> <p>Combining the identified values, goals and activities, the community’s mission statement was developed:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are a grassroots community dedicated to making research more impactful by fostering open and reproducible practices. We provide a space to engage, connect, inspire and support each other.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2> <p>The proposed next steps are to build a governance structure for the community that can act on different levels (university-wide and within the faculties), develop a community engagement and communication plan to attract and inspire new researchers to join us, and envision how the community could contribute to the necessary infrastructure developments to enable open and reproducible science practices.</p> <p>Join the core team to co-build the community together with other open and reproducible science enthusiasts!</p>]]></content><author><name>Paula Oset, Stefanie De Bodt</name></author><category term="events"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="blueprint"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take a look back at the community blueprint workshop]]></summary></entry></feed>
